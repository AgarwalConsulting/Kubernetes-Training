# Spring Greeting Service

A [simple java api](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/DockerTraining/tree/master/examples/1-web-apps/gs-rest-service), which exposes one end-point:

`GET /greeting` - It takes an optional `name` as query parameter.

The app is packaged as a docker image at [agarwalconsulting/spring-greeting](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/agarwalconsulting/spring-greeting).
