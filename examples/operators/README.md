# Writing your own operator

## What is an operator?

An **operator** is a controller that encodes human operational knowledge: how do I run and manage a specific piece of complex software.

It's composed of:

- Resources (Pod, ConfigMap, Route [OpenShift only])
- Controller (ReplicaSet, Deployment, DaemonSet)
- Domain or Application Specific Knowledge (Installing, Scale, Self-Heal, Clean Up, Update, Backup, Restore)

## Controller vs Operator

> A **controller** is a loop that reads desired state (spec), observed cluster state (othersâ€™ status), and external state, and the reconciles cluster state and external state with the desired state, writing any observations down (to our own status).

> All of Kubernetes functions on this model.

> An **operator** is a controller that encodes human operational knowledge: how do I run and manage a specific piece of complex software.

> A kubernetes operator is the name of a pattern that consists of a kubernetes controller that adds new objects to the Kubernetes API, in order to configure and manage an application, such as Prometheus or etcd.

> All operators are controllers, but not all controllers are operators.

## Setup Kubebuilder

```bash
./install-kubebuilder.sh
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/kubebuilder/bin
```

## A Simple operator

### Create a module and init using kubebuilder

```bash
mkdir -p simple-operator
cd simple-operator
go mod init <your-domain>/simple-operator
kubebuilder init --domain <your-domain>
```

### Init a Web app

```bash
kubebuilder create api --group webapp --version v1 --kind <NewKindName>
```
